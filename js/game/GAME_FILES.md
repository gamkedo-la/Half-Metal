# GAME FILES

Here is a short breakdown of the files contained in js/game and their uses.

**Main.js:** for initializing the game, loading in images/sounds, instantiating the world/characters and running the main game loop.

**World.js:** contains data and functions about the construction of the game world. Use this file to add in new tile types.

**Levels.js:** contains data and configurations for each game level. Use this file to change level designs outside of the level editor tool.

**UI.js:** a class for rendering the game HUD

**Editor.js:** contains classes for the game editor and menu buttons. This file will be used to build and extend the level editor.
