# THE PRACTICE FOLDER

Hey, HomeTeam! I've decided to add in a `practice` folder to the repo for anyone looking to improve their coding skills in whatever areas they want.

I made this folder as a practice space to give HomeTeam members an opportunity to try out various concepts without overwriting work from other people.

Feel free to create whatever files you want in it. Practice rendering, animation, game logic, anything! If you feel that you've gotten a handle on what you're practicing, feel free to transfer code to other relevant folders to implement it in the full game.

**Note:** The `practice` folder differs from the `gimmicks` folder because you may be practicing concepts that are relevant to what's already on the Trello board. However, the `gimmicks` folder is more for experimental ideas that aren't part of the original project plan.
