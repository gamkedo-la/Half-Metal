# THE GIMMICKS FOLDER

The One-offs folder is a sort of testing ground for ideas that aren't found on the project Trello board.

If you have a weird or fun idea for the game (like adding in warp tiles or teleporting enemies) add it to this folder and try it out!

Experimentation is encouraged, so be don't be afraid to try out any off the wall ideas. Be adventurous and have fun!
