## General Thoughts

1. Generally Solid puzzles - at its best when the player has been prepped to understand the underlying concepts of the levels.
2. Lots of accidental collisions with walls made it frustrating to navigate levels, especially when paired with the instant death mechanics
3. Restarting an entire level when you're right at the end is very demotivating
4. Levels are a mix between fun and frustrating

## Level Design

1. Levels in the Armory were generally received better than the Cell levels. Armory levels had more variety and taught the players new concepts step-by-step while still diving into the depths of the mechanics.
2. Cell levels lacked some prepatory material to support the player's understanding of puzzle concepts such as:
   1. Baiting enemies
   2. Leapers can destroy normal barriers only when alerted
   3. Leapers can destroy one another when alerted
   4. Leapers are only alert for a certain amount of time
   5. Leapers can't destroy sturdy barriers
   6. Ammo is not carried between levels

Level Changes:
4-8: Needs a win condition.
## Design Problems

1. Lack of ammo carry over discourages players from trying to save/acquire more shots
2. Certain skills/concepts are not conveyed early enough
3. Early levels are too challenging/frustrating for players

## Potential Solutions

1. Add an ammo limit to the player, so that they can carry over some shots but only within a reasonable limit that won't break the puzzles of following levels
2. Redesign intro levels to focus on prepping the player to learn the necessary skills of the game, then create follow-up levels to re-iterate those skills (make them stick)
3. Add more "easy wins" to the intro levels to get the player invested before they hit the more challenging parts
4. Create "ammo drain" levels that focus on destroying lots of enemies, to keep the player's ammo levels evened out
