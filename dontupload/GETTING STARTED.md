# OVERVIEW README

Hey there! Thanks for contributing to the Half-Metal project at HomeTeam Lighthouse!

To onboard members into working on the project, I've prepared this short README.

Throughout the repo are other README files that detail how to do specific things (animation, spritesheets, sound effects, etc). This file will serve as a kind of index of all those other READMEs. Each file and its topic/location will be listed below.

If you find there are other things worth explaining to your fellow HomeTeam members, please feel free to make your own README!

Thanks again, and have fun making games!
